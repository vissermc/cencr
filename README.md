# cencr
C/C++ source code encryption/mangling/minify

## Installation
npm install -g

## Usage
`cencr my_config.json`

This will encrypt all files specified in the configuration file. It will also generate some json files with information about the encryption.

The tool uses a tokenizer, but does not fully compile your code. Therefore, it does not need to know definitions, but it does need to know all locations where it can find the source files, header files, and external header files.

## Configuration file
The json file should contain a list of properties:

```
{
  property: {...} or [...]
}
```
### Configuration properties
- `headers`: An array of all the header files to encrypt
- `sources`: An array of all the source files to encrypt
- `outDir`: A folder where the encrypted files and information files will go
- `symbolOutPrefix`: A prefix for all encrypted identifiers
- `encryptFilenames`: `true`|`false`
- `fileOutPrefix`: A prefix for all encrypted filenames
- `excludedSymbols`: An array of extra symbols that should not be encrypted.
- `excludedFiles`: An array of header files that contain symbols that should not be encrypted, and were not found by parsing the files (for example, because you want to use preprocessor first).
- `searchDirs`: An array of all absolute paths were headers, sources, or external headers can be found.
### Example
```
{
    "headers": [
        "example/test.h",
        "example/test2.h"
    ],
    "sources": [
        "example/test.cpp"
    ],
    "outDir": "out",
    "symbolOutPrefix": "XZ",
    "encryptFilenames": true,
    "fileOutPrefix": "enc_",
    "excludedSymbols": [
        "excluded1"
    ],
    "excludedFiles": [
    ],
    "searchDirs": [
        "c:/dev/linux/2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64/include",
        "c:/dev/linux/2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64/arch/x86/include",
        "c:/dev/linux/2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64/arch/x86/asm",
        "c:/cygwin64/usr/include"
    ]
}
```
